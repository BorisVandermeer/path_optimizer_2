This is a newer version of my previous path planning project for autonomous vehicle [path_optimizer](https://github.com/LiJiangnanBit/path_optimizer).

## Improvements
- Higher success rate in dense/complicated environments.  
- Simpler problem formulation.  
## Dependencies, demos and usages
For now, refer to [path_optimizer](https://github.com/LiJiangnanBit/path_optimizer). It's generally the same.
